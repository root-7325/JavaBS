# JavaBS - a Brawl Stars (v12.187) server emulator ⚡
**JavaBS** is an **experimental server emulator** (even more experimental than [KyuBancho!](https://gitlab.com/root-7325/kyu-bancho)) written on **Java**.

## ⚠️ Before all
This project is in **early development state**. There's **high chance** that stated features **won't be implemented**. The code also **may** contain bugs and **questionable** solutions!

## 💭 Motivation
This project is a kind of **time machine into 2022 for me**, recreating good old days when I tried things in **Python**, lol. This is just **a fun experiment** to **relive** those memories. (coded in just **2 hours!**) 

## ✅ Implemented features
1. Netty implemented TCP server
2. Basic user session management
3. MySQL Database with Hibernate
4. TweetNaCl cryptography
5. Lobby at it's early stage (OHD only)

## 🚧 Potential Future Features
1. Player profiles
2. Leaderboards
3. Teams
4. Gatcha system
5. Stubs for some functions (matchmaking, battle log, etc.)

## ⚙️ Requirements
- Java 17 or higher
- Maven 3.6 or higher
- MySQL Server
- Patched BS client (still can be found)

## 🚀 Quick Start
1. Setup MySQL Server
    - Fill in your credentials template located in: `src/main/resources/hibernate.cfg.template.xml`
2. Build and run the server
    - Either directly from your IDE
    - Or via `mvn package` and running with `java -jar target/javabs-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`
      Don't forget to `mvn compile` after changing properties.
